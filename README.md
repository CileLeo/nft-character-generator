# nft-character-generator
use this as a random character generator. DO NOT USE THIS FOR NFTS!!!!!! THE NFT IN THE NAME IS A JOKE!!!!

## how to use this shit

### STEP 1: INSTALL THE REQUIREMENTS USING PIP
you uhhh use this command in the command prompt or whatever
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### STEP 2: configure shit
- you have to run the main.py file for the first time.
It will create multiple folders, in which you have to put your shitty .PNGs in.
- uhh.. edit the config.json. can't help you much with that.
- layer id's are just for stacking them on each other.
For example, id 1 will get put above id 0.

### STEP 3: put image files into folders and generate characters
- soo.. you have to make them pngs n shit
- make sure all of them are the same size
- run the main.py script again, it will put your shitty characters in the results folder.

### STEP 4: share your results with me on twitter by tagging me (@cile_leo)
